# Final Proyect of 'Learn SQL in one day and Learn in Well' with Python and JupyterLab

This repo containts a Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to the final project found in the book 'Learn SQL in one day and Learn in Well' by Jamie Chan. I've implemented this proyect using Python and JupyterLab, because I think that by using a jupyter book it is easier to follow the steps of the project and review previous answers if needed. 

The configuration to make the connection to the MySQL database from Python is on the notebook too, you only need to install the package *MySQL Connector Python*. If you have conda, you can install this library as follows:

```
conda install -c conda-forge mysql-connector-python
```

The only part of the notebook that cannot be done using Python is the creation of the database, you'll have to do this part using the MySQL Monitor.
